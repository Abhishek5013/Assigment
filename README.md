# üìå PCB Component Placement Solver

This is my submission for the PCB component placement assignment.

## ‚úÖ Project Overview
This project places five electronic components on a 50√ó50 board while following specific hardware constraints.

The components are:
- USB Connector
- Microcontroller
- Crystal
- MikroBus Connector 1
- MikroBus Connector 2

The placement must follow strict rules like:
- No overlapping components
- Some components must be on board edges
- Microcontroller and Crystal must be close (‚â§10 units)
- Crystal-to-micro path must avoid the USB "keep-out" zone
- The average center-of-mass must be near the center of the board

The placement is validated and visualized using the provided `Test_placement_solver_ver2.py` script.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

1. Install the required Python package:
[text](requirements.txt)

2. Run the solver:
[text](my_solver.py)

3. You will see:
- Validation output in the terminal (‚úÖ PASSED)
- A graphical plot showing the board layout

## üí° My Approach

I placed edge-constrained components (USB and MikroBus connectors) on opposite edges. Then I positioned the Microcontroller near the center and placed the Crystal close to it, while making sure all constraints were satisfied.

I used the provided validation function to check my result, and I show the final layout using matplotlib.
